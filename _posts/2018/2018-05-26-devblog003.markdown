## Early buildables

We start with one of our most exciting advances in our building systems with Teslov and basic buildables with KeZeio. Teslov has created a building system with some early models made from Brian and Pedro that already works pretty well with multiplayer.

Basic buildabes like a campfire, with some cool effects I might add, is on it's finishing stages as a object and will later be made into a placeable buildable for players to toast together after killing a ginormous beast.

Next week we might see some more buildables so you can make your clan real cozy.

## Creature Models

Kevin has created some amazing animals, some of them partially rigged and some of them fully beautiful. Here is a scarry spooky sleleton snake and a wet juicy slug.

One of them is real dangerous so look out for them in this mossy world.

## Weapons and Tools

To combat these close quarters dangerous creatures Brian scared to his teeth made himself a bow so he dowsn't get close to that juicy disgusting slug and survive to show his creation.

## Sound and Music

Hiding away in the nearest town Kevin realised there wasn't any music or any chatter and so decided to solve one of thee and produced, what I can only give a preview, a generic town music. Enjoy.

Epic Battle music are being worked on by Magic Music Man (Who just left the team without notice) and Kevin but nothing to show for now besides the amazing town music.
