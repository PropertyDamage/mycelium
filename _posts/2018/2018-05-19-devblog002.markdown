We are just getting started on our project and we already have made lots of progress this week.

## Tools, Weapons and Grass

Brian has been working on some models for our grass and our tools for the game like a Pickaxe, Bow and a Dagger.

That's it for Brian, he's currently working on a dagger and campfire he'll report on next week's devblog.

## Sound "Engineering"

We started working on basic sounds for the game and KeZeio's grunts for swings and attacks sound more than just hillarious.

Pedro on the other hand made cloth rustling, nothing fancy but adding the two sounds together in the game might make them complement eachother.

Epic Battle music and Generic Town music are being worked on but nothing to show for now since there has been almost no progress in that aspect yet.

## Armour and Sandals

Kryptex made some Steel Armour (with a beautiful skirt) and some sandals to start off for our players.

## Concept Art

Here's where the fun begins as Maia's concept art of Spell Runes. A rock with a rune drawn on it with a spell stored inside that could be thrown to enemies to kill or on allies to heal, they can also be broken in hand to release the spell on the player.

Pedro imagined these spell runes could be crafted by breaking your starter rock and enchanting on an enchantment table

Maia has also made concepts on a Dragon and a Pengwan Boss

## Menus

I'll let him explain himself what he made.

We don't exactly know why he did some parkour and also this is a christian server so no swearing KeZeio.

## Concept Map and Animals

He made a political map with capitals and everything that we will most likely be using in the game here's a sneak peak from the top of the page:

First animals were the crocodile and the penguin, for now we'll just show you the penguin in all it's glory.

That's it for the devblog, a lot more progress has been made besides what has been posted on this devblog and there will be more in the future.
