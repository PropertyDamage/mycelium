## The Introduction to our project

Since this is our first devblog, we though we'd do more of an introduction and explain what our goal and direction is etc.

## Our Goal and Direction

Our main goal is to make what we think Ruin was supposed to be, a fun, rust like fantasy game, although since we are starting stages our direction could change, we hope to deliver.

## Our Progress so far

As of right now we are working the basics of the game, base building, interacting with objects, basic models and sounds you can check the progress on our [trello][5e307404]

## How to get your hands on the game

As of right now we are not letting non-developers in the game but if you want to play our game join our [discord][25aa6b0b] and sign up as playtester and as soon we have a playable version we'll give you a key for testing the game.

## Screenshots?

As we said we are in the starting stages so the game is mainly just to playtest features so therefore, there is no points for screenshots but [here are some renders][dd215eff] of some models we made so far (these models could be changed for the final version and are most likely not final).
